# Project Description 🎮

For this project, I attempted to create a stacking mechanic similar to the one in Cube Surfer, which is a popular mobile game where players stack blocks to reach the finish line. 

## StackController 📐

The main script for stacking is called `StackController`, which handles the logic for stacking blocks. 

## Swerve Controller Scripts 🕹️

Additionally, the project includes `Swerve Controller Scripts`, which are used to control the movement of the player character.
